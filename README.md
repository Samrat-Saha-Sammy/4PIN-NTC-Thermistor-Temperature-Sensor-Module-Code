# 4 PIN NTC Thermistor Temperature Sensor Module Arduino Code
#### Arduino Code to Read Temperature from 4 pin NTC Thermistor

NTC Thermistor temperature sensor module is low cost, small size module. It is very sensitive to ambient temperature. It is generally used to detect the temperature of the surrounding environment.


## Picture 


## Technical data / Short description
This module includes a NTC Thermistor - its resistance falls with higher temperature.<br>
<strong>Digital Out (DO)</strong>: While measuring a temperature which is higher than the limit value, it will be shown here - you can set the limit value via potentiometer.<br>
<strong>Analog Out (AO)</strong>: Direct measurement of the sensor unit.<br>

<strong>LED1 (PWR)</strong>: Shows that the sensor is receiving power. <br>
<strong>LED2 (OUT)</strong>: Shows that a magnetic field was detected. <br>

<strong>Operating voltage (Vcc)</strong>: 3.3 ~ 5(volt)<br>
<strong>Temperature sense range</strong> : -25 ~ 80(Â°C) <br>
